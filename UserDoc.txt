CPS 706 Final Project User Documentation:

=====================
System Requirements
=====================

- Java 1.8
- Network Capability
- Ports 20720 and 20721 enabled and available on tcp and udp.

=====================
Demo Requirements
=====================

The Application assumes that there will be at
least four computers available on a local LAN. Servers must be initialized on each computer before
clients can connect. After which, any number of clients can perform transactions using these DHT
servers.

Therefore, demo should be carried out in the following manner:

4 x DHT Setup
N x Peer Setup

=====================
DHT Setup
=====================

Run the DServer.java file.

Follow the directions on-screen to:

    -Select Server ID (1-4)
        This number will be used to identify the Server within the ring and provide it with the
        appropriately hashed file
    -Input successor Server
        Entering the ip of the next server in the DHT ring

After doing this, the server is now set up and waiting for connections from the clients. To close
the server, a SIGINT may be sent.


=====================
P2PApp Usage.
=====================

Run P2PApp.jar using the following command:

    java -jar P2PApp.jar;

Follow the directions on-screen to setup the app:

    -Setup DHT node to contact.
        This is the entry point of this client to the network. You must input the adress of one of
        the previously set up DHTservers.

    -Select shares directory.
        This is the folder where the files that you download will be saved. The contents of this
        folder are shared publicly with other users unless receive only mode is set in the next
        option.  Set it using either a relative or absolute path.

    -Decide whether to broadcast files.
        If files are broadcasted, contents of the shares directory will be available to other
        members of the network.

Once setup, the app allows you to perform three actions:

    a)  Update: You can update the dht to inform other users that you have just added a file to your
        shares directory. Keep in mind that files were automatically added at setup time.

    b)  Query: checks other connected peers in order to download the file selected. After the file
        is downloaded, it is placed in your shares directory.

    c)  Exit: Exits the program gracefully, by dissolving this client of the responsibility of
        responding to any more requests of files previously held, but now gone.
